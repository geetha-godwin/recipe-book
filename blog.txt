        <h6>Posted on 10th Dec 2019</h6>
 
       
        <p> I wanted to learn HTML, CSS for a long time so that I develop some good looking nice sites. So I was searching to find out from which site I could learn HTML. So in this blog I explain how I happened to reach each site and finally landed on Khan Academy where I am making progress with confidence.</p>

        <p> One of my acquaintances suggested me to continue with Edureka and he suggested it is a good site to learn HTML. But then I was not satisfied since  felt it was not dealt in systematically and the tutor there referred to W3 Schools. So I decided to give W3Schools a try.</p>

        <p> Then I started with W3Schools. I was continuing in W3Schools for long and I almost finished HTML and CSS and JS were pending. But still I was not very clear since CSS was also included when dealing with HTML which was to be studied later separately. Then there was a mail from Cousera that there is a couse on web development. so I decided to give it a try.</p>

       <h3 id= "Course-era">Coursera.</h3>
 
       <h6>Posted on 25th May 2020</h6>
  
      
        <p> I enrolled in a free HTMl course in Coursera. The tutor had started with web development tools. He uses GitHub as a repository of codes for HTML. I regitered with GitHub downloaded Git Cmd. But then the tutor was using an outdated version and so I got struck. Then I was reading some comments where  one has recommended Khan Academy for learning HTML in a short time. So I decided to give it a try.</p>

        <p> I enrolled in Khan Academy for learning HTML. The course is very well designed and there is a project to be done at the end of each chapter. this gives a clear understanding of whatever has been dealt with in that chapter and so I have developed an interest  and I a progressing confidently thanks to Khan Academy. Kudos to the team for their great contribution!. Keep going!!!.</p>
